### CHAPTER 2 — The Fallout

The Jedi Temple loomed before them, its grand spires piercing the storm-darkened skies of Coruscant.
The rain had not relented, nor had the sense of unease that clung to Anakin’s soul.

Inside the High Council Chamber, the atmosphere was electric with tension.
Masters Yoda, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Plo Koon, and others sat in a solemn ring, their faces grave.

Mace Windu stood at the center of the room, soaked and battered but unbroken.
Anakin stood beside him, his tunic still scorched from the final clash with Sidious.

"The Sith Lord is dead," Mace said simply. "Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was Darth Sidious."

The words echoed through the chamber like a blaster shot.

Murmurs erupted among the Masters, disbelief and horror twisting across seasoned faces.

"Proof, you have?" Master Yoda asked, his ancient eyes narrowing.

Anakin stepped forward.
"I was there. I saw him unleash the Force in ways no Jedi ever could. I saw him try to kill Master Windu."

Silence.

Ki-Adi-Mundi stroked his chin thoughtfully.
"We have been blind," he said. "All of us."

"Too long in the shadows has the Sith dwelled," Yoda murmured.
"Now revealed, they are. But costly, this victory will be."

Anakin felt the weight of their judgment upon him—not blame, but responsibility.

Obi-Wan Kenobi, standing just outside the Council ring, caught his gaze and nodded subtly.
A sign of belief. Of brotherhood.

"We must inform the Senate," Mace said. "And prepare the Republic for what comes next."

"And what of young Skywalker?" Plo Koon asked. "His actions, though necessary, were against the Council’s directives."

Mace turned to Anakin.
For a moment, the storm outside seemed to quiet.

"He acted where we hesitated," Mace said. "He saw the darkness for what it was."

A pause.

"I move that Anakin Skywalker be granted the rank of Jedi Master, not as reward, but as acknowledgment."

Shock rippled through the room.

Even Anakin staggered inwardly.
For so long, he had sought that recognition—and now it was offered not through ambition, but through sacrifice.

Master Yoda closed his eyes, listening to currents of the Force invisible to all others.

Slowly, he nodded.

"Earned, young Skywalker has. A new path, this is."

Anakin bowed his head, humility settling where pride once burned.

The galaxy had shifted.
The Jedi had shifted.
And he stood at the heart of it.

But deep beyond the stars, in places even the Masters dared not look, something else stirred.

The death of a Sith was not the end.

It was only the beginning.
