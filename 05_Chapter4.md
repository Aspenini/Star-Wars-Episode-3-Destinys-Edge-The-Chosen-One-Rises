### CHAPTER 4 — Shifting Tides

The rain had ceased.

Morning broke across Coruscant with pale, uncertain light, painting the towers in a muted gold.
The storm had passed — but it had not left the galaxy untouched.

Inside the Jedi Temple’s Hall of Reflection, four figures stood beneath the towering statues of past Masters.

Anakin Skywalker.  
Mace Windu.  
Padmé Amidala.  
Master Yoda.

A gathering no prophecy had ever foretold.

"We have stabilized the Senate, for now," Padmé reported, her voice steady though her eyes betrayed the exhaustion beneath. "Bail and Mon Mothma are working to contain the panic."

"Contain, we must," Yoda said, tapping his gimer stick lightly against the floor. "Fear, a tool of the dark side, it is."

Mace Windu surveyed the gathering.
"There will be demands for a new Chancellor," he said. "Possibly even martial law."

"Then the Jedi must remain impartial," Anakin said firmly. "Guardians of peace, not rulers."

All eyes turned to him.

In that moment, he wasn't the impulsive Knight they had once doubted.
He stood as a Master — the Master the galaxy needed.

Padmé smiled faintly.
This was the Anakin she had believed in. The man who had chosen love and hope over fear and anger.

"We must reform the Republic," Padmé said. "Smaller powers. Localized leadership. True democracy — not central authority ripe for corruption."

Mace nodded slowly.
"We fight not just for survival now. We fight to rebuild what was lost."

Yoda leaned heavily on his cane, eyes distant.

"Always in motion, the future is," he murmured. "But a glimmer of light, I see. Because of you, young Skywalker."

Anakin bowed his head, humbled.

He did not seek to dominate.
He did not crave the Senate's applause.
He sought only peace — for Padmé, for his unborn children, for all those who had been betrayed by the darkness.

---

Beyond the brightening horizon, however, unseen by any Council or Senate chamber, warships bearing the marks of the Confederacy retreated into the Outer Rim.

Broken but not defeated.

Grievous plotted in silence.
Schemes whispered through the vacuum of space.

The Sith Lord was dead.
But the galaxy’s war was far from over.

And in the long shadow of shattered empires, something colder — and older — began to stir.
