### CHAPTER 6 — Children of Destiny

The medical chamber hummed softly, the air thick with antiseptic and hope.

Padmé Amidala lay beneath the sterile lights, her hair fanned across the white sheets like a halo.
Anakin sat at her side, his hand never leaving hers, a quiet anchor in the storm of new life.

"She’s strong," the midwife droid said warmly. "Both of them are."

The first cries echoed in the room — small, fierce, alive.

A boy.

And moments later, a girl.

Padmé's eyes shone with tears as she reached weakly toward them.

"Luke," she whispered, cradling the boy against her chest.

"And Leia," Anakin added, voice thick with emotion, lifting his daughter gently.

Twin lights born into a galaxy still trembling from the darkness.

Outside the birthing chamber, Obi-Wan Kenobi paced restlessly, arms crossed, his usual calm strained thin.

Mace Windu stood silently nearby, gaze distant.

"Do you think he’s ready for this?" Obi-Wan asked at last.

Mace was slow to answer.

"None of us were ready for the wars," he said. "None of us were ready for Sidious. Yet here we stand."

He looked toward the closed door.

"If anyone can forge a new path," he said, "it's Skywalker."

---

In the days that followed, celebrations echoed across a thousand systems.

Statues of Palpatine were torn down.
Local governments reasserted their independence.
The clone armies were dissolved, many soldiers choosing to remain and help rebuild rather than continue to fight.

Padmé, still weak but strong-willed, worked alongside Bail and Mon Mothma to draft the New Galactic Charter — a document not of empire, but of hope.

And within the Jedi Temple, the first seeds of a new Order took root.

An Order of guardians who loved.
Who protected.
Who felt.

Led not by fear.
But by faith.

---

Above Coruscant, a single starfighter slipped quietly into hyperspace, bound for the Outer Rim.

Its pilot, General Grievous, burned with vengeance.

The war was not over.

It had only changed.

And far beyond even his reach, in the cold unknown, darker forces began to stir.

Watching.
Waiting.

The children of destiny had been born.

But the galaxy's true tests had yet to come.
