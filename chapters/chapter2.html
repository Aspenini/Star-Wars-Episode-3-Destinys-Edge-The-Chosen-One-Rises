            <p>The Jedi Temple loomed before them, its grand spires piercing the storm-darkened skies of Coruscant. The rain had not relented, nor had the sense of unease that clung to Anakin's soul.</p>

            <p>Inside the High Council Chamber, the atmosphere was electric with tension. Masters Yoda, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Plo Koon, and others sat in a solemn ring, their faces grave.</p>

            <p>Mace Windu stood at the center of the room, soaked and battered but unbroken. Anakin stood beside him, his tunic still scorched from the final clash with Sidious.</p>

            <p>"The Sith Lord is dead," Mace said simply. "Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was Darth Sidious."</p>

            <p>The words echoed through the chamber like a blaster shot.</p>

            <p>Murmurs erupted among the Masters, disbelief and horror twisting across seasoned faces.</p>

            <p>"Proof, you have?" Master Yoda asked, his ancient eyes narrowing.</p>

            <p>Anakin stepped forward. "I was there. I saw him unleash the Force in ways no Jedi ever could. I saw him try to kill Master Windu."</p>

            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>Ki-Adi-Mundi stroked his chin thoughtfully. "We have been blind," he said. "All of us."</p>

            <p>"Too long in the shadows has the Sith dwelled," Yoda murmured. "Now revealed, they are. But costly, this victory will be."</p>

            <p>Anakin felt the weight of their judgment upon him—not blame, but responsibility.</p>

            <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi, standing just outside the Council ring, caught his gaze and nodded subtly. A sign of belief. Of brotherhood.</p>

            <p>"We must inform the Senate," Mace said. "And prepare the Republic for what comes next."</p>

            <p>"And what of young Skywalker?" Plo Koon asked. "His actions, though necessary, were against the Council's directives."</p>

            <p>Mace turned to Anakin. For a moment, the storm outside seemed to quiet.</p>

            <p>"He acted where we hesitated," Mace said. "He saw the darkness for what it was."</p>

            <p>A pause.</p>

            <p>"I move that Anakin Skywalker be granted the rank of Jedi Master, not as reward, but as acknowledgment."</p>

            <p>Shock rippled through the room.</p>

            <p>Even Anakin staggered inwardly. For so long, he had sought that recognition—and now it was offered not through ambition, but through sacrifice.</p>

            <p>Master Yoda closed his eyes, listening to currents of the Force invisible to all others.</p>

            <p>Slowly, he nodded.</p>

            <p>"Earned, young Skywalker has. A new path, this is."</p>

            <p>Anakin bowed his head, humility settling where pride once burned.</p>

            <p>The galaxy had shifted. The Jedi had shifted. And he stood at the heart of it.</p>

            <p>But deep beyond the stars, in places even the Masters dared not look, something else stirred.</p>

            <p>The death of a Sith was not the end.</p>

            <p>It was only the beginning.</p>
