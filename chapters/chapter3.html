            <p>The Grand Convocation Chamber buzzed with furious energy. Senators shouted across the circular hall, voices rising over the rain hammering against the high dome.</p>

            <p>The news had spread like wildfire: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine — Darth Sidious — slain by the Jedi.</p>

            <p>Trust crumbled. Fear blossomed.</p>

            <p>Padmé Amidala sat in her pod, hands clenched tightly in her lap. Around her, accusations flew: the Jedi had staged a coup, the Senate had been betrayed, the Republic was dying.</p>

            <p>Only Bail Organa of Alderaan and Mon Mothma of Chandrila stood firm at her side, loyal to democracy in a sea of rising authoritarianism.</p>

            <p>"The Jedi must answer for this!" declared Senator Ask Aak of Malastare, pounding his fist.</p>

            <p>"They have saved us!" Padmé countered, standing tall, her voice clear and powerful. "The Sith had infiltrated the highest office of our Republic! Would you have preferred we bow to a hidden Emperor?"</p>

            <p>Murmurs spread through the chamber.</p>

            <p>Some faltered. Others grew angrier.</p>

            <p>Bail leaned closer to her, voice low. "The Republic is breaking apart, Padmé. With or without the Sith."</p>

            <p>She knew it.</p>

            <p>She had seen it in the eyes of her fellow Senators. Fear was more powerful than truth.</p>

            <p>And fear, left unchecked, would birth something even darker than Sidious.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Far above, in the rain-slicked corridors of the Jedi Temple, Anakin Skywalker knelt before the High Council.</p>

            <p>His robes were new, but his soul carried scars invisible to the eye.</p>

            <p>"You have walked the narrow edge between light and dark," Yoda said, his voice soft as the falling rain. "But chosen well, you have."</p>

            <p>Anakin rose to his feet, his new rank not worn like armor, but carried like a duty.</p>

            <p>He was a Master now. But more than that — he was a symbol.</p>

            <p>Hope, in a galaxy crumbling.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>In the dark spaces between systems, remnants of the Separatists fled. General Grievous had vanished into the Outer Rim, his mechanical rage unchecked.</p>

            <p>The galaxy was not saved yet.</p>

            <p>The true war had only just begun.</p>
