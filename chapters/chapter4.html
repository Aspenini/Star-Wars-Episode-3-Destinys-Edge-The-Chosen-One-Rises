            <p>The rain had ceased.</p>

            <p>Morning broke across Coruscant with pale, uncertain light, painting the towers in a muted gold. The storm had passed — but it had not left the galaxy untouched.</p>

            <p>Inside the Jedi Temple's Hall of Reflection, four figures stood beneath the towering statues of past Masters.</p>

            <p>Anakin Skywalker.<br>
            Mace Windu.<br>
            Padmé Amidala.<br>
            Master Yoda.</p>

            <p>A gathering no prophecy had ever foretold.</p>

            <p>"We have stabilized the Senate, for now," Padmé reported, her voice steady though her eyes betrayed the exhaustion beneath. "Bail and Mon Mothma are working to contain the panic."</p>

            <p>"Contain, we must," Yoda said, tapping his gimer stick lightly against the floor. "Fear, a tool of the dark side, it is."</p>

            <p>Mace Windu surveyed the gathering. "There will be demands for a new Chancellor," he said. "Possibly even martial law."</p>

            <p>"Then the Jedi must remain impartial," Anakin said firmly. "Guardians of peace, not rulers."</p>

            <p>All eyes turned to him.</p>

            <p>In that moment, he wasn't the impulsive Knight they had once doubted. He stood as a Master — the Master the galaxy needed.</p>

            <p>Padmé smiled faintly. This was the Anakin she had believed in. The man who had chosen love and hope over fear and anger.</p>

            <p>"We must reform the Republic," Padmé said. "Smaller powers. Localized leadership. True democracy — not central authority ripe for corruption."</p>

            <p>Mace nodded slowly. "We fight not just for survival now. We fight to rebuild what was lost."</p>

            <p>Yoda leaned heavily on his cane, eyes distant.</p>

            <p>"Always in motion, the future is," he murmured. "But a glimmer of light, I see. Because of you, young Skywalker."</p>

            <p>Anakin bowed his head, humbled.</p>

            <p>He did not seek to dominate. He did not crave the Senate's applause. He sought only peace — for Padmé, for his unborn children, for all those who had been betrayed by the darkness.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Beyond the brightening horizon, however, unseen by any Council or Senate chamber, warships bearing the marks of the Confederacy retreated into the Outer Rim.</p>

            <p>Broken but not defeated.</p>

            <p>Grievous plotted in silence. Schemes whispered through the vacuum of space.</p>

            <p>The Sith Lord was dead. But the galaxy's war was far from over.</p>

            <p>And in the long shadow of shattered empires, something colder — and older — began to stir.</p>
