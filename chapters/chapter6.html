            <p>The medical chamber hummed softly, the air thick with antiseptic and hope.</p>

            <p>Padmé Amidala lay beneath the sterile lights, her hair fanned across the white sheets like a halo. Anakin sat at her side, his hand never leaving hers, a quiet anchor in the storm of new life.</p>

            <p>"She's strong," the midwife droid said warmly. "Both of them are."</p>

            <p>The first cries echoed in the room — small, fierce, alive.</p>

            <p>A boy.</p>

            <p>And moments later, a girl.</p>

            <p>Padmé's eyes shone with tears as she reached weakly toward them.</p>

            <p>"Luke," she whispered, cradling the boy against her chest.</p>

            <p>"And Leia," Anakin added, voice thick with emotion, lifting his daughter gently.</p>

            <p>Twin lights born into a galaxy still trembling from the darkness.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Outside the birthing chamber, Obi-Wan Kenobi paced restlessly, arms crossed, his usual calm strained thin.</p>

            <p>Mace Windu stood silently nearby, gaze distant.</p>

            <p>"Do you think he's ready for this?" Obi-Wan asked at last.</p>

            <p>Mace was slow to answer.</p>

            <p>"None of us were ready for the wars," he said. "None of us were ready for Sidious. Yet here we stand."</p>

            <p>He looked toward the closed door.</p>

            <p>"If anyone can forge a new path," he said, "it's Skywalker."</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>In the days that followed, celebrations echoed across a thousand systems.</p>

            <p>Statues of Palpatine were torn down.<br>
            Local governments reasserted their independence.<br>
            The clone armies were dissolved, many soldiers choosing to remain and help rebuild rather than continue to fight.</p>

            <p>Padmé, still weak but strong-willed, worked alongside Bail and Mon Mothma to draft the New Galactic Charter — a document not of empire, but of hope.</p>

            <p>And within the Jedi Temple, the first seeds of a new Order took root.</p>

            <p>An Order of guardians who loved.<br>
            Who protected.<br>
            Who felt.</p>

            <p>Led not by fear.<br>
            But by faith.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Above Coruscant, a single starfighter slipped quietly into hyperspace, bound for the Outer Rim.</p>

            <p>Its pilot, General Grievous, burned with vengeance.</p>

            <p>The war was not over.</p>

            <p>It had only changed.</p>

            <p>And far beyond even his reach, in the cold unknown, darker forces began to stir.</p>

            <p>Watching.<br>
            Waiting.</p>

            <p>The children of destiny had been born.</p>

            <p>But the galaxy's true tests had yet to come.</p>
