### PROLOGUE — The Eye of the Storm

The rain howled against the shattered windows of the Chancellor’s office, each gust rattling the transparisteel like a war drum.
Lightning flared, casting stark shadows across the chaos inside.

Mace Windu’s violet blade sizzled at Darth Sidious's throat, pulsing with restrained judgment.
Sidious, the master of all deceptions, crouched like a wounded animal, hate and desperation twisting his aged features.

Anakin Skywalker stood at the threshold, soaked from the storm outside, heart hammering against his chest.
He saw the betrayal.
He saw the lies laid bare.

And, in the stillness between thunderclaps, he chose.

Anakin moved without hesitation.
The blue blade of his lightsaber ignited with a snap-hiss, cutting the darkness.
Sidious turned toward him, reaching out, whispering one final poisoned promise—

—and died screaming as Anakin drove the saber through his chest.

Lightning exploded outward in a deafening blast.
The Sith Lord’s body convulsed violently, dark energy lashing against the room before collapsing into stillness.

Silence fell.

The storm outside raged on, but inside, there was only the sound of Anakin’s ragged breathing and the gentle hum of the two lightsabers still active.

Mace Windu turned to Anakin, rain dripping from his soaked robes, a mixture of awe and grim understanding etched across his face.

The Sith were not invincible.
The darkness could be fought—and defeated.

Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, had made his decision.

Not for power.
Not for revenge.
For the light.
