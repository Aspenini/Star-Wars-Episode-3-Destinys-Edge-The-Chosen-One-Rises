### CHAPTER 1 — The Choice

The storm raged outside, battering the high towers of Coruscant with relentless fury.
Inside the shattered remains of the Chancellor's office, Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu stood over the lifeless form of Darth Sidious.

For a long moment, neither spoke.

The weight of what had been done—and what had been prevented—hung heavily between them.

"You did the right thing," Mace finally said, his voice low but resolute. "The galaxy owes you a debt it can never repay."

Anakin stared at the smoldering corpse, memories and fears warring within him.
Had it been justice? Or vengeance? Was there even a difference anymore?

"I didn't do it for the Republic," Anakin said, almost a whisper. "I did it for her."

Mace's brow furrowed.
He understood far more than he let on.

"The Council will need to know everything," he said. "The galaxy must know what the Sith have done. But your actions... they have given us hope."

Hope.

The word sounded foreign in Anakin's mind.
He thought of Padmé—alive, safe.
He thought of Obi-Wan, of the Jedi younglings, of a future not ruled by darkness.

Mace deactivated his lightsaber with a sharp hiss. "Come, Skywalker. We have much to do. And little time to do it."

Together, they turned from the broken remnants of Palpatine’s throne and stepped into the rain-soaked night, two warriors who had defied destiny itself.

But somewhere deep in the shadows of Coruscant, other eyes were watching.

And fate had not yet finished with them.
