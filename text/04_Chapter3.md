### CHAPTER 3 — Cracks in the Republic

The Grand Convocation Chamber buzzed with furious energy.
Senators shouted across the circular hall, voices rising over the rain hammering against the high dome.

The news had spread like wildfire:
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine — Darth Sidious — slain by the Jedi.

Trust crumbled.
Fear blossomed.

Padmé Amidala sat in her pod, hands clenched tightly in her lap.
Around her, accusations flew: the Jedi had staged a coup, the Senate had been betrayed, the Republic was dying.

Only Bail Organa of Alderaan and Mon Mothma of Chandrila stood firm at her side, loyal to democracy in a sea of rising authoritarianism.

"The Jedi must answer for this!" declared Senator Ask Aak of Malastare, pounding his fist.

"They have saved us!" Padmé countered, standing tall, her voice clear and powerful. "The Sith had infiltrated the highest office of our Republic! Would you have preferred we bow to a hidden Emperor?"

Murmurs spread through the chamber.

Some faltered.
Others grew angrier.

Bail leaned closer to her, voice low.
"The Republic is breaking apart, Padmé. With or without the Sith."

She knew it.

She had seen it in the eyes of her fellow Senators.
Fear was more powerful than truth.

And fear, left unchecked, would birth something even darker than Sidious.

Far above, in the rain-slicked corridors of the Jedi Temple, Anakin Skywalker knelt before the High Council.

His robes were new, but his soul carried scars invisible to the eye.

"You have walked the narrow edge between light and dark," Yoda said, his voice soft as the falling rain.
"But chosen well, you have."

Anakin rose to his feet, his new rank not worn like armor, but carried like a duty.

He was a Master now.
But more than that — he was a symbol.

Hope, in a galaxy crumbling.

---

In the dark spaces between systems, remnants of the Separatists fled.
General Grievous had vanished into the Outer Rim, his mechanical rage unchecked.

The galaxy was not saved yet.

The true war had only just begun.
