### CHAPTER 7 — Shadows Beyond

The Outer Rim territories were silent.

Too silent.

In the ashes of the defeated Separatist Council, fragments of armies scattered like embers before the storm.
Worlds that had once burned with rebellion now drifted, lawless and forgotten.

But not all who vanished had been defeated.

Beneath the cold, forgotten stars, in regions beyond even the maps of the Jedi Archives, new powers gathered.

Grievous, wounded and vengeful, carved a bloody path through the wild systems, rallying the remnants of the droid armies under his broken banner.

Pirate clans, warlords, rogue generals — all found purpose in his hatred.

And above them all, unseen and unknown, something else stirred.

Something older than the Sith.

Something that had waited, patient, beyond the edges of known space.

It watched as the Republic rebuilt itself.
It listened as the Jedi remade their Order.
It smiled — if such things could be said to smile — at the birth of new hope.

Hope was dangerous.

Hope inspired resistance.

And so, in the dark places beyond the light, the future of the galaxy was shaped not by councils or senates or chosen ones — but by silent shadows that plotted their return.

In the Temple, Anakin stood before a gathering of younglings.

Their eyes wide, their minds open.

No fear.
No chains.

He knelt before them, the Master who had once walked the razor’s edge between destruction and destiny.

"Understand your emotions," he told them. "But do not be ruled by them."

The children listened, not as soldiers obeying a general, but as students seeking wisdom.

A new Jedi Order was being born.

Not perfect.
Not invincible.

But alive.

And in the farthest reaches of the galaxy, in the cold between stars, a voice whispered into the void:

*"The light has returned."*

*"We must answer."*

*"Soon."*
