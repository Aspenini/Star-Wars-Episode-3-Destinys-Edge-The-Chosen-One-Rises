### EPILOGUE — Next Dawn

Ten years later.

The twin suns of Naboo rose over the glittering fields, painting the world in hues of gold and rose.

Children laughed in the distance.  
Birds soared overhead.  
Peace — real peace — had taken root.

In a quiet meadow, Anakin Skywalker stood watching two figures spar with wooden practice sabers.

Luke Skywalker, quick and reckless, grinned as he launched himself at his opponent.

Leia Organa, calm and cunning, sidestepped easily and tapped her brother on the shoulder with a practiced flick.

Anakin chuckled softly.

Obi-Wan Kenobi, seated nearby under the shade of a tree, sipped a cup of tea and shook his head.

"Your son has your spirit," he said.

"And my recklessness," Anakin admitted, folding his arms.

Padmé Amidala approached, her long gown brushing the grass.
Her face was serene, touched by time but no less radiant.

"They both have something greater," she said, slipping her hand into Anakin’s. "Hope."

---

Across the galaxy, the New Republic flourished.

Systems once isolated by fear now thrived through cooperation and trust.

The Jedi Order, rebuilt under a new philosophy of balance and compassion, served as guardians — not generals.

Anakin and Obi-Wan shared the burden of training the next generation.

Yoda, retired to the peaceful swamps of Dagobah, occasionally offered cryptic advice through long-distance meditation.

The darkness, for now, had retreated.

But Anakin knew — as did Obi-Wan, and Padmé, and the Council — that peace was not a destination.

It was a constant choice.

One that must be made, again and again, every single day.

---

And somewhere, far beyond the stars visible to mortal eyes, an ancient power shifted restlessly.

Not Sith.
Not Jedi.

Something else.

Watching.
Waiting.

For the next dawn.
